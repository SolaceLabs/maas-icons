[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/maas-icons.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maas-icons) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Setup npm registry

Before installing the package this step needs to be completed.

You can authenticate to GitHub Packages with npm by creating a `~/.npmrc` file in your root directory.

```
@solacedev:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=GITHUB_TOKEN
```

GITHUB_TOKEN needs to be replaced by user specific github token. Make sure the package permissions ( write:packages, read:packages ) are correctly selected during token creation, and SSO is also enabled.

See this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to create github token. Read more about [packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages) permissions.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @solacedev/maas-icons
```

## Usage

Import the SVG sprite file to top level of the application. And then look at [Icons enum](./src/icons.ts) for which ID to use.

```tsx
import { ReactElement } from 'react';
import { ReactComponent as SolaceSvgs } from from '@solacedev/maas-icons/dist/svg/sprite.symbol.svg';

const App = (): ReactElement => {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Imported svg sprites should be hidden in the dom. */}
      <div style={{ display: "none" }}>
        <SolaceSvgs />
      </div>
      <OtherComponents />
    </>
  );
};
```

To import an illustration using ReactJS (assuming you have proper SVG support with babel/webpack):

```tsx
import { ReactElement } from "react";
import { ReactComponent as Designer } from "@solacedev/maas-icons/dist/illustrations/designer.svg";

const Demo = (): ReactElement => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Designer />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Sample preview of the sprite

The build step will create a sample page with all the monochrome SVGs [here](./dist/index.html).

# How to add new Icons

1. Rename the SVG file to use camelCase eg: `arrowUp.svg`
2. For monochrome SVGs, `./icons` folder is the main directory to store SVG files. If a new subfolder is required try to use just the size name. eg: `./icons/24px`
3. For illustrations SVGs, `./illustrations` folder is the location to store them. These SVGs are copied as-is into the `./dist` folder.
4. Add the new SVG file to appropriate folder under **icons** directory
5. Create a Pull Request and then release the package. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) for package release.

**Note for developers** : Don't forget to include one of the following values in a commit, before pushing your branch to master. This would trigger an automated package version update.

| Value | Defintition                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| major | MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes                      |
| minor | MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner |
| patch | PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes                |
